# Burnt Area Mapping in Lamington National Park looking at initial burnt area and how this area recovered between December 2019 and December 2020.

## This project was a part of the GEOM3001 Course I took at UQ in Semester 2, 2024. 
## Tasked with proposing a project utilizing geospatial data this notebook code file
## written in Python contains all of the code used to produce the report (which can be
## found on my website).

## This file has been heavily adapted from the original base template provided in the DEA sandbox.
